          <strong>What learnings did you take from the chapter? </strong>
            <p>That the many forms of emotional intelligence and mindfulness is trainable and
              obtainable by anyone. Even from a few hours of meditation training it has been
              proven to make a difference in how someone reacts to particular events.
              <br>It is also useful in many different types of jobs, and those who rise to
              higher positions often have a higher level of emotional intelligence.
