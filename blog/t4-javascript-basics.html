                    <strong>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</strong>
                    <p>While HTML is your content and CSS is your style. JavaScript is your function. How you wish for items on your page to interact with the user and itself.</p>

                    <strong>Explain control flow and loops.</strong>
                    <p>Control flow is the order of operations within your code. You don't brush your teeth, eat breakfast and then get out of bed. So control flow is important to keep things in the right place. <br> Loops is managing how many times you will do a certain action until it has done it enough and must stop. Brushing your teeth should be brushed back and forth more than once, but it also needs to stop at some point otherwise you'll never get anything else done.</p>

                    <strong>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</strong>
                    <p>One of the main differences is the way in which data is listed in each. Arrays access the data by what number they are listed within itself. Where as data in an object is accessed by calling certain strings. Such as looking up someones "LastName" and it returning the stored name.</p>

                    <strong>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</strong>
                    <p>It is where the work/calculations happen. If you need something to count and loop or perform an "if" statement then this is called a function.</p>
