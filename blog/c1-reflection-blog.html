          <strong>What's your take on the EDA experience? </strong>
          It's all about changing the way we learn and cooperate with others. What kind of mindset we bring to the table and how to get the best out of ourselves and others
        </p>
      <strong>What are your impressions? </strong>
      That everyone from teachers to students are here for the same thing, that they want to learn and contribute to/from each other.
    <p>
      <strong>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? </strong>
      The more I learn of the culture the more I am interested in being a part of it. Though I am generally a bit of a lone wolf I am seeing the benefits of working with a pack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how? </strong>
      No not really. Having talked to a number of people from EDA and actually going in for a visit I got a good idea before hand of the culture and it is much the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous? </strong>
      Anything new and different will always make someone a little nervous. But the more I read and learn about it the more logical and practical it sounds.
