      <strong>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try? </strong>
      <p>The Fogg Method of creating tiny habits I found very simplistic and easy to try and with some success too. I already incorporate my own kind of meditation through sport being able to clear my mind and create a single focus. Often refered to by sportsmen as "The Zone".</p>
    </p>
      <strong>What did you find interesting? </strong>
      <p>The Pomodoro Technique is very interesting and something that I will try to adopt. I will often get either distracted easily or be able to focus on a single task for a long period of time which ultimately burns me out. I am hoping this will create a good balance for me.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>What worked for you? </strong>
      <p>The Fogg Method of creating tiny habits. My room has never been cleaner haha.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Which will you experiment further with? </strong>
      <p>Both the Fogg Method and the Pomodoro Technique. I will obviously carry on with my sports meditation but may try the standard meditation style also.</p>
