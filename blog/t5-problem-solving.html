                    <strong>What was the problem?</strong>
                    <p>My main problem was actually using CodeAcademy. The amount of times I was pulling my hair out in frustration simply due to the poor wording of the questions being asked was quite ridiculous.</p>

                    <strong>What problem solving techniques did you use?</strong>
                    <p>I "just googled it". First I looked for other people who were having similar issues (which there was a fair few of), and then I tried to answer the question again. If I was still struglling then I went back for more hints until I could figure it out on my own.</p>

                    <strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong>
                    <p>Frustration first. Then relief that I wasn't the only one having similar problems. Then joy from being able to process through the material.</p>

                    <strong>What did you learn?</strong>
                    <p>That having adequate English skills and being able to explain something properly is still very important in coding.</p>
                    <br>

                    <strong>Reflection</strong>
                    <p><em>Pseudocode</em> - Is a good way to get a step by step guide for yourself on how you would like your code to run though I feel like it could get a bit messy if I tried to do it often.</p>

                    <p><em>Trying something</em> - Bit of a no brainer really. If you don't try something then you'll never do/learn anything.</p>

                    <p><em>Rubber ducky method</em> - While I may keep a rubber ducky as a nice desk pet, I can easily have a conversation with myself internally instead.</p>

                    <p><em>Reading error messages</em> - Sometimes error messages make sense, sometimes they do not.</p>

                    <p><em>Console.logging</em> - I would prefer using debugging.</p>

                    <p><em>Googling</em> - My "go to" solution resource. Easy answers if you know what you're looking for but can make it hard to absorb how to tackle the problem as it's easy to just copy, paste, forget.</p>

                    <p><em>Asking your peers for help</em> - Haven't really needed to ask peers yet. Being about a week behind in the course most of the problems I would have asked help with had already been discussed and solved in Slack.</p>

                    <p><em>Asking coaches for help</em> - Haven't needed to yet but if Google fails me then I may ask for help.</p>

                    <p><em>Improving your process with reflection</em> - I think it helps. It's a hard thing to measure how much it actually helps.</p>
                    <br>

                    <strong>Describe what these functions do in your own words</strong>
                    <p><em>.map()</em> - From an existing array it will apply a function to it resulting in a new array while keeping the original untouched.</p>

                    <p><em>.filter()</em> - Will again create a new array from another that only contains elements with certain desired properties.</p>

                    <p><em>.reduce()</em> - Is used to either simplify or compress a given array. Either creating the sum of numbers or counting the number of times items in the array appear and flattening the data out. Plus a few other possiblities.</p>
